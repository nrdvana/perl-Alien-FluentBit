=head1 SYNOPSIS

To Install fluent-bit from source:

  $ apt-get install cmake flex bison m4  # not required but saves time
  $ cpanm Alien::FluentBit

To install fluent-bit from official binary release:

  $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent/fluent-bit/master/install.sh | sh
  $ export LD_PRELOAD=/lib/fluent-bit/libfluent-bit.so # see below
  $ cpanm Alien::FluentBit

To use:

  use Alien::FluentBit;
  say "Commandline tool is ".Alien::FluentBit->fluentbit;
  say "Compile flags are ".Alien::FluentBit->cflags;
  say "Link flags are ".Alien::FluentBit->libs;

See the Makefile.PL of Fluent::LibFluentBit for a full example.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution either finds fluent-bit installed on your system (currently only at the
slightly odd locations used by the binary dist for Debian systems) or builds it from source.

Currently only building from source works properly, as the binary dist library conflucts with
perl related to TLS allocations, and needs pre-loaded.  Pre-loading a giant library like this
into every program you invoke is not ideal, so the from-source build is recommended.

Note that this module currently provides a custom minimal "fluent-bit.h" because the one from
upstream is broken.  This minimal header is also available as "fluent-bit-minimal.h"
